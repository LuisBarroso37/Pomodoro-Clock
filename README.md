# Pomodoro Clock
Pomodoro Clock Project - freeCodeCamp

In this project I made a Pomodoro Clock.

Pomodoro is a time management method created by Francesco Cirillo which consists of using a timer to break down work into intervals separated by short breaks.

You can set a session length and a break length between 1 min and 60 min.
When you press play the timer will start counting down. When the clock reaches zero you will hear a signal and the break timer will start counting down.
